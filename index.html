        <h1>My Journey To Learn Code After 44</h1>  
        <p>With a lack of a hobby, a few previous attempts at learning programming, 
            and the arrival of Chat GPT, all the stars seem to align for an exciting journey 
            on learning <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>. Here's my travel report.</p>
        
        <h2>Great Resources</h2>
